  abstract = { Pharmaceutical supply chain (PSC) consists of multiple stakeholders including raw material suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, regulatory authorities, pharmacies, hospitals, and patients. The complexity of product and transaction flows in PSC requires an effective traceability system to determine the current and all previous product ownerships. In addition, digitizing track and trace process provides significant benefit for regulatory oversight and ensures product safety. Blockchain-based drug traceability offers a potential solution to create a distributed shared data platform for an immutable, trustworthy, accountable and transparent system in the PSC. In this paper, we present an overview of product traceability issues in the PSC and envisage how blockchain technology can provide effective provenance, track and trace solution to mitigate counterfeit medications. We propose two potential blockchain based decentralized architectures, Hyperledger Fabric and Besu to meet critical requirements for drug traceability such as privacy, trust, transparency, security, authorization and authentication, and scalability. We propose, discuss, and compare two potential blockchain architectures for drug traceability. We identify and discuss several open research challenges related to the application of blockchain technology for drug traceability. The proposed blockchain architectures provide a valuable roadmap for Health Informatics researchers to build and deploy an end-to-end solution for the pharmaceutical industry. }

One potential solution for improving security, integrity, data provenance, and functionality of the health supply chain is blockchain technology.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Objectives: Provide an overview of the opportunities and challenges associated with blockchain adoption and deployment for the health supply chain, with a focus on the pharmaceutical supply, medical device and supplies, Internet of Healthy Things (IoHT), and public health sectors.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Methods: A narrative review was conducted of the academic literature, grey literature, and industry publications, in addition to identifying and characterizing select stakeholders engaged in exploring blockchain solutions for the health supply chain.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Results: Critical challenges in protecting the integrity of the health supply chain appear well suited for adoption of blockchain technology. Use cases are emerging, including using blockchain to combat counterfeit medicines,&amp;amp;nbsp;securing medical devices, optimizing functionality of IoHT, and improving the public health supply chain. Despite these clear opportunities, most blockchain initiatives remain in proof-of-concept or pilot phase.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Conclusion: Blockchain technology has the unrealized promise to help improve the health supply chain, but further study, evaluation and alignment with policy mechanisms is needed.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Keywords:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;amp;nbsp;Blockchain, Distributed Ledger, Pharmacy, Pharmaceutical, Supply chain&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;}, journal={Blockchain in Healthcare Today}, author={Clauson, Kevin A. and Breeden, Elizabeth A. and Davidson, Cameron and Mackey, Timothy K.}, year={2018}, month={Mar.} }

abstract = {Fabric is a modular and extensible open-source system for deploying and operating permissioned blockchains and one of the Hyperledger projects hosted by the Linux Foundation (www.hyperledger.org).Fabric is the first truly extensible blockchain system for running distributed applications. It supports modular consensus protocols, which allows the system to be tailored to particular use cases and trust models. Fabric is also the first blockchain system that runs distributed applications written in standard, general-purpose programming languages, without systemic dependency on a native cryptocurrency. This stands in sharp contrast to existing block-chain platforms that require "smart-contracts" to be written in domain-specific languages or rely on a cryptocurrency. Fabric realizes the permissioned model using a portable notion of membership, which may be integrated with industry-standard identity management. To support such flexibility, Fabric introduces an entirely novel blockchain design and revamps the way blockchains cope with non-determinism, resource exhaustion, and performance attacks.This paper describes Fabric, its architecture, the rationale behind various design decisions, its most prominent implementation aspects, as well as its distributed application programming model. We further evaluate Fabric by implementing and benchmarking a Bitcoin-inspired digital currency. We show that Fabric achieves end-to-end throughput of more than 3500 transactions per second in certain popular deployment configurations, with sub-second latency, scaling well to over 100 peers.},

abstract = {Smart contracts are more sensitive from a security perspective than other software due to several reasons. First, smart contracts are immutable thus cannot be easily patched once deployed. Second, smart contracts are directly tied to payments and can hold millions of dollars’ worth of digital currencies. Third, smart contracts are still a new practice thus do not have best coding practices and development lifecycles tailored for decentralized apps yet. Even though several testing and verification tools have been developed, smart contract vulnerabilities remain a clear and present danger. In this paper, we present an approach that is different from existing ones that attempt to eliminate vulnerabilities from smart contracts. Instead, we fortify Ethereum virtual machines (EVM) to stop dangerous transactions once vulnerabilities are detected in real-time. Since proving programs written in Turing-complete languages is undecidable, our approach complements current approaches by catching vulnerabilities and interrupts their executions during runtime. We have implemented our reinforcement on two widely used EVMs (js-evm and FISCO-BCOS-evm). The reinforced EVMs detects and interrupts all the vulnerabilities, 20% of them missed by testing tools, in 100 real smart contracts. Our approach is practical with less than 34% overhead. In fact, the reinforced FISCO-BCOS-evm has been integrated into the official release of FISCO-BCOS adopted by a large Chinese bank — WeBank.}
